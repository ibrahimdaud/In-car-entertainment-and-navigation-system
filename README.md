# In-car-entertainment-and-navigation-system
This an in-car entertainment and navigation system prototype designed in Axure.
The system should enable the user access to music and navigation services - focusing on these two areas. 
The prototype gained inspiration based off concepts and principles, such as Interaction Design theory and cognitive psychology. However, to ensure safety it is essential that the system doesn’t divert the driver’s attention from the road as the consequences could be catastrophic.
